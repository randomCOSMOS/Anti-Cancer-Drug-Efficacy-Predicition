# Anti Cancer Drug Efficacy Prediction
A simple ML model to predict the efficacy of Anti-Cancer Drug

## Data
- The data used in this work is from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) which was developed by the Sanger Research Institute in the United Kingdom.
- We considered 10 drugs and gene expression data for 1,000 human cancer cell lines.

## Features
- The drug response indicators used were the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the area under the curve (AUC).
- IC50: It indicates how much drug is needed to inhibit a biological process by half.
- AUC: gives insight into the extent of exposure to a drug and its clearance rate from the body.
